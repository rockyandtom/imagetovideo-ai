## 1. General Policy

Thank you for choosing **Image To Video AI**. Our goal is to provide a transparent and fair billing experience. Due to the nature of our service, which involves significant computational costs for AI processing upon use, our general policy is that **all purchases are final and non-refundable**.

When you purchase a subscription or a credit pack, you are paying for the immediate right to use the service and its AI resources. Once these resources are used, the associated costs are irreversible.

*   **Change of Mind**: You are not satisfied with the Service or have changed your mind about your purchase.
*   **Subjective Quality of AI Output**: You are not satisfied with the quality, style, or specific results of the videos generated by our AI. The nature of AI involves variability, and we cannot guarantee specific outcomes.

*   **Billing Error**: You were charged incorrectly due to a technical billing error on our part (e.g., a duplicate charge for the same billing period).
*   **Major Service Unavailability**: A critical technical failure on our platform prevents you from accessing the core functionality of the Service for an extended period (e.g., more than 72 consecutive hours). This does not include scheduled maintenance or issues outside of our direct control.
*   **Fraudulent Transactions**: A payment was made from your account without your authorization. We require verifiable proof of the fraudulent transaction from your financial institution.
